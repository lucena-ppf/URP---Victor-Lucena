# protoDUNE's position and energy predictor
* This is a repository for the versions of my Undergraduate Research Program code versions. The main objective of this work is learning about neural networks their usages to physics modelling.

- An important feature for the liquid argon time projection chambers of the DUNE experiment to have is the capability to determine interaction region and deposited energy of low energy particle interactions occurring in their sensitive volumes. Hence, a machine learning study based on regression tasks using feedforward neural networks is being developed to examine its possibility.

- The data used for training and testing precedures is given by a simplified Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of the vertical drift large scale prototype being installed at CERN.

- The research process is being conducted by considering both its internal region as a whole and just its field cage, using all the photon detection system within the structure.
